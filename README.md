Converge
========

NOTE: Not usable. Not a single feature is usable. Stop looking.

Collaboration and Communication platform. Currently mostly for discussions. If I would add the buttons for posting things.

It also provides some other fun, like:

 * task management (rudimentary)
 * activity streams (rudimentary, to be done)
 * content publishing (rudimentary, to be done)
 * converging all other kinds of communications, like IM and email (to be done)

See? We are disruptive. Innovative. What do you want more? A finished app?

**OMGz!**
