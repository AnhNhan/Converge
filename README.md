enables fast and hassle-free exchange and consumption of opinions with a high
signal-to-noise ratio.

It also provides some other fun, like:

 * content publishing (to be done)
 * converging all other kinds of communications, like IM and email (to be done)

Contributing
============

When you contributing you have to accept the Contributor License Agreement.

* You forfeit all legal ownership claims and rights to your contributed content
* You assure that the contributed content is either
    * free of any license legalities (as in, free for us to use and derive)
    * or contains the necessary permissions for us to use it both commercially and non-commercially, including any applicable patent licenses
* You can not pull back the contributed content - not because we are evil corporate lawyers, but see above
* You are still guaranteed credit where credit is due (usually your name and email as commit authorship attribute)
* You can still say "I did this!" for bragging rights only
